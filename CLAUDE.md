# Working on this repo

## The default branch is the release

The owner installs and updates the SloppyMods mods straight from GitHub: RimSort
clones this repository's default branch (`main`) into RimWorld's Mods
folder and pulls it in place. There is no separate release step, so **every
commit pushed to `main` is what the game loads next**.

- Push finished work to `main`. Nothing half-done: each commit must load
  and play as-is.
- **Commit the compiled assemblies.** RimWorld loads the DLL, not the source,
  and a clone gets only what is in git. This mod needs:
  - `Assemblies/RiimbaMod.dll`
  - `Mods/TrashChute/Assemblies/RiimbaChute.dll`
  `.gitignore` must not exclude them (a bare `Assemblies/` rule does, at any
  depth - un-ignore those paths). Rebuild and commit the DLLs in the same
  commit as any C# change; a stale DLL is what players get.
- **Stamp the build number before every commit** so the mod list and RimSort
  show which build is installed: `<modVersion>` in `About/About.xml`, and a
  `Build x.y` line at the top of its description, set to
  `series.<commit count after this commit>` (series 0.9 unless
  `Tools/modtool.conf` says otherwise). With the shared tooling in `Tools/`
  that is `python3 Tools/stamp_version.py`, and `Tools/validate.py` fails
  while it is stale; without it, set the same value by hand. Never leave a
  placeholder like `0.9.0-dev`.
- Keep `packageId` unchanged: saves and RimSort key on it. The display
  `<name>` is "SloppyMods Riimba".
- Everything in the repository root lands in the Mods folder, so keep
  anything RimWorld might try to load (Defs, Patches, Textures, LoadFolders)
  deliberate; `Source/`, `Tools/`, docs and images are ignored by the game.
- A zip for the Steam Workshop or manual testing still comes from
  `bash Tools/package.sh` (shared tooling) when asked.
- **Publish a GitHub Release for every build.** RimSort's GitHub Mods panel
  reads "Latest Version" from the newest release's tag and installs that
  release's single `.zip` asset; with no releases it shows only `HEAD` and a
  blank version. Once `Tools/` (shared tooling) and the committed DLLs are on
  this branch, copy `.github/workflows/release.yml` from
  kanid99/Sloppymod-Rimworld-EntertainMe: on each push it checks the stamp,
  packages with `Tools/package.sh` and publishes `v<modVersion>` with the zip.
- `LoadFolders.xml` loads `Mods/TrashChute` only when Vanilla Expanded Framework and Vanilla Recycling Expanded are both active; its assembly must be committed too.

## Standing preferences

- Licence is CC0 for every SloppyMods mod.
- Replies to the owner: concise summaries; attach a build zip when they will
  test in game.
- For art changes, show prototypes or before/after comparisons and get the
  owner's approval per item before replacing anything.
