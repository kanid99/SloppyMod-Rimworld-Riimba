"""Draws the Riimba control station's three rotations.

The station is 3x1 and its three docking bays sit one per cell along the edge it
FACES. That is not a decoration: RiimbaSpots.BayCells takes the row of cells outside
rot.FacingCell, and Building_RiimbaStation sends each unit to the bay matching its
roster position. So the art has to put a bay where the C# puts one, for every rotation,
or a unit drives to a blank stretch of casing to charge.

Which means the rotations cannot be made by rotating one image:

    north   the station faces north, so the bays are along the TOP edge
    south   faces south, bays along the BOTTOM edge
    east    faces east, bays along the RIGHT edge, on a 192x576 canvas
    west    not drawn - Graphic_Multi mirrors east, which correctly moves the bays
            to the left edge, and west's FacingCell is (-1, 0, 0)

Light always comes from the top of the screen whatever the rotation, which is why the
south view is drawn rather than flipped: flipping would light the bays from below.

    python3 Source/Art/riimba_station.py      # from the repo root

Run verify_bays.py afterwards - it samples the real textures at the cells the C#
computes and checks a bay is actually there.
