"""Builds About/Preview.png and About/ModIcon.png from the real sprites.

Composited from the shipped textures rather than drawn separately, so the store page
cannot drift from what is actually in the game. Re-run it after any texture change.

RimWorld looks for both at those exact filenames under About/ - see
ModMetaData.PreviewImagePath and ModIconImagePath - so no path entry is needed in
About.xml.
