"""Draws the Riimba drone's three rotations.

RimWorld's camera never rotates, so the three sprites are three VIEWS of the same
object, not three rotations of one image. Turning the south sprite 180 degrees would
put the sensor on the far side of the disc but also put its highlight on the bottom,
lit from below, which reads as a hole rather than a bump.

So each view is drawn: south shows the face (sensor and bumper towards the camera),
north shows the back (vent grille and lifting handle), east shows the profile with the
face to the right. West is not drawn at all - Graphic_Multi mirrors east for west, and
a disc is symmetric about that axis.
