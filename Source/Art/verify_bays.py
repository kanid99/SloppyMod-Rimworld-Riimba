"""Checks the station art agrees with RiimbaSpots about where the bays are.

This exists because the mending mod shipped an east texture with its ports on the wrong
cells and nobody caught it by looking. The failure is quiet in exactly the same way
here: a station rotated east would still work, units would still charge, and the only
symptom would be a drone parked on a blank stretch of casing.

So the check is mechanical. RiimbaSpots.BayCells is reimplemented below from the C#,
run for all four rotations against a 3x1 footprint, and the resulting cells are
translated into pixel positions in whichever texture that rotation draws. A bay must be
found at each of them, and the opposite edge must be clear.

    python3 Source/Art/verify_bays.py      # from the repo root

Exits non-zero on any mismatch, so it can be wired into a build.
